# Developer Shell Creator (DSC)
This program is designed to create a developer shell, namely:

- Creating .venv
- Create src, build, texture folders
- Initializing Git in project

You can also study the source code and add some more instructions to it, for example, creating some more folders, creating a builder file, installing the necessary libraries, etc.
